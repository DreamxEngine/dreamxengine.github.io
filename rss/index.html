The moment I think of DreamxEngine, I imagined it as a ship ... a ship with a journey that head towards the direction of the sea of dreams. Where, the abundance of dreams originated by humanity has lost and scattered around in the midst of fantasy realm islands that time-lock all the missing puzzles of dreams. Legends said, if you have collected all your dreams pieces and united them, your dream may come true. Of course, to collect all your dream pieces aren't come easy, you have to faced those mystic creatures and monsters who guards the dream pieces along the way ... Back to the reality ... the same thing could be apply, right now, DreamxEngine is designed and built by me and my team members to collect and fulfils the dreams that not only belong to us, but also for those who believe in us and entrust us with the responsibilities and support us for this embarking journey. Again, <b>"DreamxEngine is a ship ... with a journey"</b>.
